# Movies Explorer

This web app is displaying movies from Web API in a grid. It's build using ReactJs, ReduxJs & CSS.

This app is created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but nothing of the script codes/boilerplates are used, I only used is to do the configuration part for me.

This app is packed using [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) which is depending on webpack.
